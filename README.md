# 🌾 Crop Moisture & Humidity Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview

Post-harvest crop losses due to excess moisture and humidity are a major challenge faced by farmers and wholesale buyers. This project proposes a smart monitoring system that continuously measures moisture and humidity levels in harvested crops and alerts users when unsafe thresholds are exceeded, helping prevent spoilage and decay.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Harvested seeds and crops often deteriorate during storage and transportation because of uncontrolled moisture and humidity levels. This leads to reduced crop quality, financial losses, and food wastage.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A smart component-based system that:

* Monitors moisture and humidity in harvested crops
* Detects when values exceed safe limits
* Alerts users to take timely preventive action

This ensures better crop preservation and reduced post-harvest losses.
